This repo contains all the solutions for the NodeSchool's "Kick Off Koa" Workshop.

It pretty much contains fundamentals examples for the KoaJS Framework (NodeJS) core, routes, basic middlewares and more

## Koa Framework

For this exercises, the version used is the 2.x of it, but it doesn't change a lot compared to the 3.x 
of it.

## Personal Note

I think that ExpressJS is way more easy to use and adapt, but still is a pretty good alternative for basic APIs and Backend tasks.
